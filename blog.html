<h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>
<p>I had some trouble setting up Github Pages, but I re-read the tutorial page on it and figured it out after reviewing the steps.</p>
<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>
<p1>I learned how to set up Github Pages. I already knew the HTML and CSS basics, but it was nice getting a refresher.</p1>
<h2>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>
<p1>I used W3Schools HTML introduction article to remind me on how to initially start an HTML file, and that was about it.</p1>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
<p>It was a rough start, because it's been so long since I've used CSS that I didn't realize how much I'd forgotten. But what was roughest was DEFINITELY getting used to flex displays again, and also the stupid logo not being in the right place. And the button not showing up!! Why won't the add post button show up?!</p>
<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
<p> I learned that I really need to get better at flex displays.</p>
<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
<p> W3 schools was a big one. I meant to start this way earlier and I wish I had so I could've asked the TAs or some of my friends who are better at CSS for help.</p>
<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
<p>Flex displays, grids/columns, fixed positioning, and also several color codes.</p>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
<p>I'm genuinely going to be seeing the filter JS in my dreams tonight. I originally had some trouble with incorrectly labeling my classes, but that got solved easily. The filtering though. Oh my god. I did my best to solve the big problems but it still does not re-filter properly.</p>
<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
<p1>I learned patience. I learned that sometimes I need to step away from my computer before I break my keyboard in frustration. And to take my meds before working on assignments.</p1>
<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
<p1>Google. TAs. My fellow classmates. At one point, begging ChatGPT for advice because it was like 1am and I wanted to go to bed. It had no advice. The TAs helped the most and helped me get a better understanding of what I was actually doing.</p1>
<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
<p>Well, I originally thought I somehow messed up connecting the JS to the HTML because it wasn't working at all, but it turned out that I just was naming things wrong. And then a lot of error codes.</p>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
<p>Probably the fact that I put it off until the very last minute and I'm doing it at 11:53pm. I chugged my girlfriend's coffee for this. I'm going to lose my mind.</p>
<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
<p1>To stop procrastinating on assignments. And that Handlebars are really cool when you understand them (somewhat).</p1>
<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
<p1>Classmates. Google.</p1>
<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
<p>Handlebars tutorials.</p>
